1860年，一位名叫威廉.洛的英国人提出了一项更好的计划。

He suggested that a double railway-tunnel should be built.
他提议建一条双轨隧道，

This would solve the problem of ventilation, for if a train entered this tunnel, it would draw in fresh air behind it.
这样就解决了通风问题。因为如果有列火车开进隧道，它就把新鲜空气随之抽进了隧道。

Forty-two years later a tunnel was actually begun.
42年以后，隧道实际已经开始建了。

If, at the time, the British had not feared invasion, it would have been completed.
如果不是因为那时英国人害怕入侵，隧道早已建成了。

The world had to wait almost another 100 years for the Channel Tunnel.
世界不得不再等将近100年才看到海峡隧道竣工。

It was officially opened on March 7,1994, finally connecting Britain to the European continent.
它于1994年3月7日正式开通，将英国与欧洲大陆连到了一起。

he set off down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo.
骑上一头名叫江伯的小象，沿着城里的主要街道出发了。

He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing.

A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic.
一个警察走过来告诉吉米，他应该走一条小路，因为江泊阻碍了交通。

Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move.
虽然吉米同意马上就走，但江伯却拒绝移动。

Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street.

The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused.
警察虽然吃了苦头，但他们还是感到很有趣。

'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards,
“江伯一定有好几吨重，”一个警察事后这样说，

'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him.
“值得庆幸的是它没让我们抬它走。

Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.'
当然，我们应该逮捕它，但由于它一贯表现很好，这次我们饶了它。”

Lesson 66  Sweet as honey! 像蜜一样甜！

In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island, a remote place in the South Pacific, a long way west of Samoa.
1963年，一架兰开斯特轰炸机在瓦立斯岛坠毁。那是南太平洋中一个很偏僻的小岛，位于萨摩亚群岛以西，距离群岛还有很长一段距离。

The plane wasn't too badly damaged, but over the years, the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed.
飞机损坏的程度并不严重，但是，多年来这起飞机失事已被遗忘，飞机残骸也没受到破坏。

Then in 1989, twenty-six years after the crash, the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island.
于是，到了1989年，飞机失事26年后，在对小岛的一次航空勘查中那架飞机被意外地发现了。

By this time, a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing.
到了那个时候，状况良好的兰开斯特轰炸机实属罕见，值得抢救。

The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France.
法国政府让人把飞机包装起来，一部分一部分地搬回法国。

Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored.
一群热心人计划修复这架飞机。

It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt.
该飞机装装配有4台罗尔斯-罗伊斯的默林发动机，但是他们只需要修复其中的3台。

Imagine their surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey -- still in perfect condition.
想一想他们所感受到的惊奇和兴奋 -- 当他们拆开包装箱时，他们发现第4台发动机就像蜂蜜一样甜 -- 发动机完好无损。

A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved in beeswax!
一群蜜蜂把发动机当作了蜂房，发动机在蜂蜡中被完整地保存了下来。

Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long.
尽管他设法拍了一些十分精彩的照片，但他却不能在火山附近停留太长的时间。

He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him.
他发现有一股岩浆正向他流过来，

It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape just in time.
眼看就要将他团团围住，但塔捷耶夫还是设法及时逃离了。

He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later.

当你游览伦敦时，首先看到的东西之一就是“大本”钟，即那座从英国广播公司的广播中全世界都可以听到它的声音的著名大钟。

If the Houses of Parliament had not been burned down in 1834, the great clock would never have been erected.
如果不是国会大厦在1834年被焚毁的话，这座大钟永远也不会建造。

Big Ben takes its name from Sir Benjamin Hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the new Houses of Parliament were being built.

A painter who had been working on the tower hung a pot of paint on one of the hands and slowed it down!
在钟塔上干活的一位油漆工把一只油漆桶挂在了一根指针上，把钟弄慢了！

Lesson 73  The record-holder 纪录保持者

Children who play truant from school are unimaginative.
逃学的孩子们都缺乏想像力。

A quiet day's fishing, or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again, is usually as far as they get.
他们通常能够做到的，至多也就是安静地钓上一天鱼，或在电影院里坐上8个小时，一遍遍地看同一部电影。

They have all been put to shame by a boy who, while playing truant, travelled 1,600 miles.

He hitchhiked to Dover and, towards evening, went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep.
他搭便车到了多佛，天快黑时钻进了一条船，想找个地方睡觉。

When he woke up next morning, he discovered that the boat had, in the meantime, travelled to Calais.

The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city.
司机给了他几块饼干和一杯咖啡，就把他丢在了城外。

The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would, but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border.
男孩截住的下一辆车，没有像他希望的那样把他带到巴黎市中心，而是把他带到了法国和西班牙边界上的佩皮尼昂。

There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities.
他在那儿被一个警察抓住了，之后被当局送回了英国。

He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading school.
他无疑为成千上万梦想逃避上学的孩子们创造了一项纪录。

'I'm sheriff here. Do you see that notice? It says "No Camping" -- in case you can't read!'
“我是这里的司法长官。你们看到那个布告牌了吗？上面写着‘禁止野营’－－除非你们不识字！”

'Look, sheriff,' said Rockwall, 'don't be too hard on us.
“好了，好了，司法官，”罗克沃尔说， “别使我们难堪。

所以，医生们一直试图搞清这位妇女是否死于一种罕见的疾病。

The only way to do this was to operate.
搞清的唯一办法就是手术。

The operation, which lasted for over four hours, proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin.
手术持续了4个多小时，非常难做，因为皮肤上覆盖着一层硬硬的树脂。

The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory.
医生们从木乃伊身上取下一个切片，送去化验。

They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show: a small wax figure of the god Duamutef.
他们还发现了X光片所没有显示的东西：一个蜡制的杜瓦木特夫神小塑像。

Lesson 81  Escape 脱逃

When he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes.
那个战俘杀死卫兵以后，迅速地把尸体拖进了灌木丛。

Working rapidly in the darkness, he soon changed into the dead man's clothes.

the prisoner marched boldly up and down in front of the camp.
在军营门前大胆地来回走着。

He could hear shouting in the camp itself.
他听得军营里面的喧闹声。

Lights were blazing and men were running here and there: they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped.

Lesson 82  Monster or fish? 是妖还是鱼？

Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea.
渔夫和水手们有时声称自己看到过海里的妖怪。

Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen,
虽然人们常常对水手们讲的故事付诸一笑，

it is now known that many of these 'monsters' which have at times been sighted are simply strange fish.
但现在看来，人们有时看到的这些“妖怪”很多不过是些奇怪的鱼。

Occasionally, unusual creatures are washed to the shore, but they are rarely caught out at sea.
一些异常的生物偶尔会被冲到岸上来，但它们在海上却极少能被捕到。

Some time ago, however, a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar.
然而不久前，在马达加斯加附近的海里却捕到了一条奇怪的鱼。

A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line.
一条小渔船被一条咬住钩的强壮的大鱼拖到了几英里以外的海面上。

Realizing that this was no ordinary fish, the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way.
那位渔民意识到这根本不是一条普通的鱼，于是千方百计不让它受到丝毫伤害。

When it was eventually brought to shore, it was found to be over thirteen feet long.
当终于把它弄上岸后，人们发现它身长超过了13英尺。

It had a head like a horse, big blue eyes, shining silver skin, and a bright red tail.
它长着一个像马一样的头，有着大的蓝眼睛和闪闪发光的银色皮肤，还有一条鲜红色的尾巴。

The fish, which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist, is called an oarfish.
此鱼叫桨鱼，被送进了博物馆，现正接受一位科学家的检查。

Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet.
人们很少能看到活着的这类动物，因为它们生活在600英尺深的水下。

昨天的那位警察正从门口慢慢走过，帕特里克上前问了和昨天同样的问题。

Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.
虽然那位警察这次有点疑心，但还是对他作了同样的回答。

The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.
第三天，帕特里克又去了，提出了同前两天完全一样的问题。

This time, the policeman lost his temper. 'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday,' he shouted,
这一次警察火了。“我昨天和前天都告诉过您了，”他大叫着，

'Mr. Lane was defeated in the elections.
“莱恩先生在大选中被击败了，

He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad!'
他已经退出了政界去国外了！”

'I know,' answered Patrick, 'but I love to hear you say it!'

Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast!
只有一两个人提出反对意见，说学生们会把车开得太快！

A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday.
很多老同学都准备参加下星期四为他举行的告别宴会。

It is a curious coincidence that the day before his retirement, Mr. Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years.
佩奇先生退休的前一天正好是他执教满40年的日子，这真是奇妙的巧合。

After he has retired, he will devote himself to gardening.
他退休后，将致力于园艺。

For him, this will be an entirely new hobby.
对于他来说，这将是一种全新的爱好。

But this does not matter, for, as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.

他们两个还没来得及意识到究竟发生了什么事情，就被猛地抛入了海里。

The speedboat had struck a buoy, but it continued to move very quickly across the water.
快艇撞上了一个浮标，但它仍在水面上快速行驶着。

Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore, when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a circle.
两个人刚开始向岸边游去，就突然惊愕地发现快艇正在转着圈行驶，

It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed.
它现在正以惊人的速度直冲他们驶来。

In less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away.
不到1分钟的工夫，它从离他们只有几英尺远的地方呼啸着驶了过去。

After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return.

It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'

Lesson 88  Trapped in a mine 困在矿井里

Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours.
6个人被困在矿井里已有17个小时了。

If they are not brought to the surface soon they may lose their lives.
如果不把他们尽快救到地面上来，他们就有可能丧生。

However, rescue operations are proving difficult.
然而，事实证明营救工作非常困难。

If explosives are used, vibrations will cause the roof of the mine to collapse.
如果用炸药爆破，震动会引起矿顶塌落。

Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine.
因此，营救人员在矿井的北侧钻了一个洞。

They intend to bring the men up in a special capsule.
他们准备用一种特制的容器把这6个人救上来。

If there had not been a hard layer of rock beneath the soil,

they would have completed the job in a few hours.
他们的营救工作仅用几个小时就可以完成了。

As it is, they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go.

If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock, they would lose heart.
如果他们知道了钻透那坚硬的岩石有多么困难，他们会丧失信心的。

Lesson 89  A slip of the tongue 口误

People will do anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one.
人们总要想尽办法看不花钱的演出--哪怕是拙劣的演出。

When the news got round that a comedy show would be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company,
当“皮尤”鸟食公司将在我们当地影院演出喜剧节目的消息传开后，

we all rushed to see it.
我们都赶紧跑去观看。

We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began.
我们不得不排了好几个小时才进得场去。在演出开始前场内肯定已有好几百人了。

Unfortunately, the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen.

Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed, as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come.
那些没能进到场内的人没有必要感到失望，因为很多应该出场的专业演员都没有来。

The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme.
那天晚上唯一有趣的事情是节目开始时那个报幕员的开场白。

He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone.
他显然非常紧张，局促不安地在麦克风前站了好几分钟。

As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone burst out laughing.
但他刚一开口说话，人们便哄堂大笑起来。

We all know what the poor man should have said, but what he actually said was:
我们都明白那个可怜的人应该说些什么，而他实际说的却是：

'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company. Good ladies, evening and gentlemen!'
“这是‘浦伊’鸟食公司，好女士们，晚上和先生们！”

Lesson 90  What's for supper? 晚餐吃什么？

Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain,
油煎鱼加炸土豆片一直是英国人喜爱的一道菜，

but as the oceans have been overfished, fish has become more and more expensive.
但是随着海洋里的滥捕滥捞，鱼已经变得越来越昂贵。

So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs.
因此，听说北海石油钻井平台上的潜水员受到巨型鱼类的恐吓，确实很让人吃惊。

Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers, who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water,
钻井平台需要经常修理，潜水员常常要在水面100英尺以下摸黑工作，

have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work.
他们曾在工作时被撞到他们身上的大鱼吓得惊惶失措。

Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters.
现在他们有了特制的笼子，用来保护他们免受大鱼的侵袭。

The fish are not sharks or killer whales,
这些鱼并不是鲨鱼或逆戟鲸，

but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes, sometimes as much as twelve feet in length.
而是深受人们喜爱的食用鱼品种，如鳕鱼和鳐鱼，只不过它们长得出奇地大，有时长达12英尺。

Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large:
这些鱼能长得这么大是由3个因素造成的：

the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea;
海底热的输油管道附近的温暖的海水；

the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs;
钻井平台工作人员抛到海里充足的食物；

the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs.
钻井平台周围根本没有捕鱼船只。

As a result, the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water. Who eats who?
结果是，这些鱼就在可爱的温暖的水流中吃呀吃，长呀长。究竟谁吃谁呢？

The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news, because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft.

He said that someone might be spying on the station and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object.
他说可能有人正对基地进行侦察，因此命令那个飞行员跟踪那个奇怪的飞行物。

飞行员设法绕着气球飞了一阵。

He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars.

Soon afterwards, the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield.
不久，气球开始降落，在一个停机坪附近着了陆。

The police were called in, but they could not arrest anyone,
警察被召来了，但他们却不能逮捕任何人，

for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station!
因为筐里是两名国会议员和一名基地的指挥官！

As the Commanding Officer explained later, one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing!
正如指挥官后来解释的那样，基地的这半边不知道那半边正在干什么！

so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it against the wall, and began climbing towards the bedroom window.
于是，我从花园的小棚里搬来了一个梯子，把它靠在墙边，开始向卧室的窗口爬去。

I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.'
快要爬到窗口时，下面一个人用讽刺的口吻说：“我看不必在夜里这个时候擦窗子吧。”

I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman.

I immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'
我回答了他的话，但马上又后悔不该那样说，我是这样说的：“我喜欢在夜里擦窗子。”

'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone. 'Excuse my interrupting you.
“我也是的，”警察用同样的声调回答，“请原谅我打断了您。

I hate to interrupt a man when he's busy working, but would you mind coming with me to the station?'
当一个人在忙着干活时，我是不愿意去打断他的，但请您跟我到警察局去一趟好吗？”

'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see. I've forgotten my key.'
“可我更愿意呆在这儿，”我说，“您瞧，我忘带钥匙了。”

'Your what?' he called.
“什么？”他大声问。

'My key,' I shouted.
“钥匙！”我喊道。

Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards me.
幸运得很，这喊声惊醒了我的妻子。就在警察开始向我爬上来时，她打开了窗子。
