When I was 13 my only purpose was to become the star on our football team.
当我13岁，我唯一的目标是要成为我们的橄榄球队的明星。

That meant beating out Miller King, who was the best player at our school.
这意味着击败国王米勒，​​他是我们学校最好的球员。

Football season started in September and all summer long I worked out.
足球赛季在9月开始直到整个夏天，我懂了。

I carried my football everywhere for practice.
我抱着足球处处练习。

Just before September, Miller was struck by a car and lost his right arm.
就在九月前， Miller 被车击中，失去了他的右臂。

I went to see him after he came back from hospital.
我去看他，待他从医院回来后。

He looked very pale, but he didn't cry.
他看上去很苍白，但是他没有哭。

That season, I broke all of Miller's records while he watched the home games from the bench.
那个赛季，我打破了 Miller 的所有记录，而他看了主场比赛从板凳。

We went 10-1 and I was named most valuable player, but I often had crazy dreams in which I was to blame for Miller's accident.
我们去10-1，我被评为最有价值球员，但我常常有疯狂的梦——我被责怪因为 Miller 的意外。

One afternoon, I was crossing the field to go home and saw Miller stuck going over a fence — which wasn't hard to climb if you had both arms.
一天下午，我正在过场回家，看到米勒卡住在一个栅栏——如果你有双臂这并不难爬。

I'm sure I was the last person in the world he wanted to accept assistance from.
我敢肯定，我是世界，他想接受援助的最后一个人。

But even that challenge he accepted.
但即使这样的挑战，他接受了。

I helped him move slowly over the fence.
我帮他慢慢地移过了栅栏。

When we were finally safe on the other side, he said to me, "You know, I didn't tell you this during the season, but you did fine. Thank you for filling in for me."
当我们最后安全地在另一边，他对我说，“你知道，我没有告诉你这个在这个赛季，但你做得很好。谢谢你为我加油（填充我）。”

His words freed me from my bad dreams.
他的话解放了我从我不好的梦。

I thought to myself, how even without an arm he was more of a leader.
我心想，他即使没有手臂也更（像）是一个领导者。

Damaged but not defeated, he was still ahead of me.
破损但不能被击败，他仍然在我前面。

I was right to have admired him.
我是正确的去钦佩他。

From that day on, I grew bigger and a little more real.
从那天起，我变得更大，更真实。
